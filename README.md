# Test projects

## Project reference:

This repository created to learn how to create TUI apps on most popular framework [ncurses](https://github.com/mirror/ncurses), his fork with RGB, gradient and picture render systems, named as [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses), and one beautiful framework, named [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI).

All apps will be written for a different areas of use.

1. First app will be written on FTXUI would be Telegram TUI client;

2. Second app will be written on ncurses would be mail client based on curl (Thunderbird TUI analog);

3. Third app will be written on notcurses and for this time i don't know for what.

May be after creating apps, they will be moved to another repositories.

### Help:

If you have ideas for third application, write to [@DedXacaHOfficial](https://t.me/DedXacaHOfficial) or to Emails, connected to my account.
